# Price of Houses
### Business Goal 
To model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

## General Information
### Problem Statement
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the file `train.csv` file  and the data dictionary is provided in the file `data_description.txt`

 The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularization in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

### Solution Approach
Given the problem statement and the data provided, we have performed the following steps:
### 1. Data Preprocessing
### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### 3. Feature Selection
### 4. Model Building
### 5. Model Evaluation
### 6 Interpretation

## Conclusions
We were able to build a model that helps the company to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.
